# CV-Classification
##  **Summary:**

There are some neutral networks of computer vision, such as GoogleNet, ResNet, DenseNet. They have achieved great results on many datasets and tasks. In order to have a better command of these networks and study to get a good result by adjusting parameters, I try to train and test them at some classical datasets. For each model, you have many methods to optimize and you can also choose pre-trained networks. Welcome to have a try !

##  **Dataset:**

### MNIST:

MNIST dataset consist of gray images of handwritten numbers by different people, which with size of $28\times28\times1$â€‹. MNIST consists of images of 10 classes, i.e. number from 0 to 9. The training and test sets contain 60,000 and 10,000 images respectively.

### CIFAR: 

The two CIFAR datasets consist of colored natural images with size of $32\times32\times3$. CIFAR-10 consists of images of 10 classes and CIFAR-100 consists of images of 100 classes. The training and test sets contain 50,000 and 10,000 images respectively.
