# CV-Classification
##  **Summary:**

There are some neutral networks of computer vision, such as GoogleNet, ResNet, DenseNet. They have achieved great results on many datasets and tasks. In order to have a better command of these networks and study to get a good result by adjusting parameters, I try to train and test them at some classical datasets. For each model, you have many methods to optimize and you can also choose pre-trained networks. Welcome to have a try !
